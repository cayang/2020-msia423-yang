Lois' favorite quote:

"" A person who is a master in the art of living makes little distinction between their work and their play, their labor and their leisure, their mind and their body, their education and their recreation, their love and their religion. They hardly know which is which and simply pursue their vision of excellence and grace, whatever they do, leaving others to decide whether they are working or playing. To them, they are always doing both.""

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.  

My places are located in Chicago, Miami Beach and San Francisco. I've lived in all 3 cities and am happy to suggest hidden local gems or recommend the best nearby dry cleaner.

Departure is by 11am. Later departures will be accommodated if possible. If people are arriving the same day, we will allow you to store fully packed luggage (zipped closed with everything inside) to be stored near the entry to the unit so you can return to pick up your luggage.

For non-emergencies, please send a message through the system or call/text. If you are contacting me, please remember that California is 2 hours behind Chicago.

I do my best to be helpful with advice on the city and to be around to answer local questions.  

I enjoy travel, movies, playing with my cat and exploring cities - including my own, Chicago.  I grew up on the West Coast in the wine country southwest of Portland, Oregon.  I went to university in a small school in Indiana, and ended up staying in the Great Lakes region, first a couple years in Minnesota and in Chicago for 22+ years, more time than any other city in my lifetime.  I've lived in my present place, in the River North neighborhood, for 15+ years now and really enjoy it for its close proximity to so much in the central area and excellent access to transit, while my building still manages to be quiet and peaceful.

I've traveled a fair bit myself, having visited over half of the States here in the U.S., plus Canada (Toronto), Mexico (Yucatan, Cancun, Mexico City), Panama (Panama City), Spain (Madrid, Barcelona), Puerto Rico (San Juan, Vieques, Ponce), France (Paris, Lyon), China (Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei), Sweden (Stockholm), Switzerland (Geneva), the Netherlands (Maastricht), England (London), Austria (Vienna), Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Haugesund, Feoy), Finland (Helsinki), Turkey (Istanbul) and Russia (Moscow, Tver, Novgorod, Leningrad/St. Petersburg, Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk - it was still the U.S.S.R. at the time) and Andorra.

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.  

My places are located in Chicago, Miami Beach and San Francisco. I've lived in all 3 cities and am happy to suggest hidden local gems or recommend the best nearby dry cleaner.

I try and learn one new thing a year - last year it was learning restoration of 1880's slate roof/facades with a craftsman and architect friends. This year, bringing artists to Pullman and Pullman to artists. Next, maybe exploring more permaculture ideas/trends.  

I have an absolutely lovely girlfriend who travels with me whenever possible (Amy).

Thanks for checking out my properties, I hope you'll come to stay! 

A little about me: I'm a 39 year old professional photographer, traveler and serial entrepreneur. I've Sailed from Panama to Fiji over 7 months and solo cycled New Zealand and Australia for 6. I spent 4 weeks on a spiritual hermitage in India, trekked around Europe a bit, bushwhacked around the jungles of Panama treasure hunting 16th century Spanish artifacts, and have fallen in love with Cuba, twice. 

I recently lived in Costa Rica for 18 months but now live in Guanajuato, Mexico, developing several businesses. 

My life motto is, 'What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?' And I'd eat guacamole or hummus every day if at all humanly possible! :)

I lived in Chicago for 9 years, and I've lived in Guanajuato now for the past 3 years, so I'm happy to recommend all the best bars, restaurants and activities (and tourist traps to avoid). I love giving local advice so please feel free to ask! 

And if ever you need anything, I'm always just a quick call, text or email away!

I hope you enjoy your visit to Chi or GTO, and I look forward to sharing my homes with you!

Texting is the best way to reach me.,"Guests are expected to treat the apartment as they would an aunt's or their mother's friend's house.  ( I hesitate to say your own friend's house, because, personally, I'm never particularly well-behaved at my good friends' houses.  Especially while on vacation.) The agreed upon number of guests is the limit.  If someone stops by for a glass of wine, it's no big deal. But, no parties, etc. There are plenty of places nearby for loud group revelry. Shoes should come off in the apartment. This is not a cleanliness issue; I'm not worried about little messes, etc.  But, shoes sound like thunder to the apartment dweller below. If something breaks, it's not a big deal.  I won't leave anything out that you'll need to worry about.

Earphoria started as an AV podcast featuring interviews and acoustic sessions with musicians.  I realized that there was a need for shared living/playing space for musicians living in and traveling to cities. 

Earphoria's original location in Chicago, IL started in 2012 and is now a co-op which is overseen by a fantastic group of hosts involved in music, visual art, gardening, and community organizing.  You can find out more information by searching for Earphoria: Chicago.

In 2014 I moved to Austin, TX and started a second location.  I currently reside here with my family for most of the year.  There is a rotating group of musical guests and hosts that care for the space.  You can find more information by searching Earphoria: Austin.  

We hope to connect with you further!

We've enjoyed hosting many guests from all over the world, and we're always excited to share our wonderful city and neighborhood with new visitors.  We are honored to be considered a second home for many visiting family and friends in the neighborhood.

I've lived in the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood over 15 years and have seen a lot of amazing changes.  There is always a new restaurant opening while old favorites just get better with time.

I grew up in Chicago and returned home in 1996 after earning an Urban Studies degree from Brown University.  I started running the Wicker Park Inn in 2004.  Over the years, we've updated and expanded the Wicker Park Inn which now includes four guestrooms and three apartments.  We are staffed with amazing innkeepers, Robin and Emily, and our impeccable cleaning staff.

Tracy and Josue here. :) We've been living in Chicago for quite some time now. Beautiful city to travel to! A little bit about us. I (Tracy) used to be a photographer but decided to change careers and become a Mortician.  Josue is a Socialite, Traveller, Humanitarian, Activist, Producer and Investor. We love everything we do and hosting for Airbnb is definitely one of them.  When our guests are happy we are happy. We will do everything we can to make your stay as comfortable and amazing as possible. Josue is great with directions, places to check out, things to do, events and nightlife. He knows how to make an awesome drink as well! I love to cook and try new recipes. We both like to go out and experience nightlife, love being foodies and trying out new restaurants when the time permits. Love to travel as well, but Chicago is our Home for now! We are happy to share the experience!
